# Songs-ink Project Proposal
### Team Songs-ink - Caleb Huss, Jacob Maniscalco, Hieu Phan, Chase Yandle

## Project Overview
The Songs-ink App is a web application to join multiplayer rooms, play a drawing and guessing game, and earn points that are used to skip or shuffle the music currently playing.  Points can also be used to add words to the user's personal category.

## Stretch Goals
1. Battle-royale type game mode where one drawer keeps their role and the last to get the correct answer is knocked out; winner can be the new drawer or can cycle through:choice of passing made during the creation of the room. Also Ultimate Royale where the creator of the room contributes some of their points as a prize and one royale game is played with the creator as the drawer, winner gets the points and creator of the room gets profile points to add unique things to their profile.
2. Tournament with prizes. Requires some kind of fees to participate like drawing points.
3. User selects their profile picture from a game they play in.
4. Display drawings at the end. Could show stats like “Guessed Quickest” or “Most Guesses."
5. Add Private rooms.
6. Add reporting / take action on reported players.
7. Have points / statistics update on the player profile.
8. Have a room specific playlist that everyone listens to together.
